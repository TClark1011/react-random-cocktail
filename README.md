# A One Day Project

Every week I try to do a little one day project with the goal of learning something new

## Random Cocktails

The project is a one page web app that delivers the user randomly selected Cocktail recipes. It was developed using react with typescript as well as styled components. Data is fetched from the super cool [CocktailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/).

## Learning Objective

The goal for this one day project was to try out a CSS-in-JS solution. I've been using SCSS in all my react projects and decided it was time to try out an alternative. I ended up going with [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components), which I ended up really liking. I didn't really structuring it well here, I repeated a lot of my variables instead of using a provider but ultimately I think I will try it out in a few more projects to decide if I really want to commit to it.
